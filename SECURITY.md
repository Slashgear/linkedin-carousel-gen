## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing the maintainers directly instead of opening a public issue.

Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to address the issue.
